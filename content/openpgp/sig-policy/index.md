# Status

This is only a draft (WIP).

# Signing keys

For the highest authenticity level the data should be signed with my OpenPGP
smart card key `0xAF85991CC95049A242051933BCA9943DD1DF4C04`.
I also often use my primary key `0xAD098E6B008A7CB009ED25F11E8B02C29318BA46`.

# Git

All my Git commits should be automatically signed with the key
`0x86A74A5507D058D1322E37FD130826A6C2A389FD`.
