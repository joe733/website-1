- Fix the deployment script (currently only a hack)
- Finalize the CSP (at least `style-src 'self'` is required and makes sense)
  - Try to resolve the other CSP violations by dropping stuff from the theme
    (especially JS and all third party references)
- Fork and customize the theme
- Add content (duh)
